        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This easy paneer recipe is great for vegetarians. You can add paneer to your favorite curry or dish.<br/> Homemade paneer is softer and lighter than the tofu-like consistency of paneer found in many Indian restaurants.        </p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon milk</li>
    
                <li>1 quart buttermilk</li> 
                    
                <li>1 cup canola oil for frying</li>
                    
            </ul>
        <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour milk into a large pot and bring to a boil over medium heat; watch carefully to prevent milk from boiling over. When milk begins to boil, pour buttermilk into the pot in a steady stream, stirring constantly. The milk will separate into curds and water.</li>
                <li>Line a colander with cheesecloth. Pour milk mixture through the cheesecloth, reserving some of the strained liquid. Let milk mixture sit in the colander until curds are settled and dripping stops, about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Transfer strained curds to a food processor. Process until smooth and mixture can be formed into a ball. Add some of the reserved liquid and process again if mixture is too dry. The consistency should resemble firm ricotta cheese.

                </li>
                <li>Turn cheese out onto a clean surface and knead until smooth. Form into a ball and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
                <li>To cook paneer, heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cut paneer into bite-sized pieces. Fry in hot oil until very pale golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
